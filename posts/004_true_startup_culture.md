# True Startup Culture

I have this game I play on HackerNews everytime a new startup is looking for
the next best hacker. I look for two words in the job listing and almost
every single time you will not see the word 'revenue' and every single time
you will definitely not see the word 'profit'. Instead you will most probably
see a catalog of the various arcade machines and flavours of coffee available
at all times in the office. You'll also see collection of VC angels listed
somewhere on the page and it seems like that gets more limelight than the actual
job description itself. Oh but they will boast about their amazing 'culture'
after mentioning share options and other things I don't really care for.

The word culture has become so miscontrued these days it's not even funny.
I thought about the five software companies I have worked at over the last three
years and which elements of each actually added to the company's culture.

My first job was at a company of five people, I sat less than two metres from my
boss, we didn't even have an office with a door. We were basically part of the
reception area at the coworking space we were at. That was irrelevant, I had an
Ikea desk, irrelevant. Before my first day I was given a company shirt and a
Macbook Pro. The Macbook didn't matter, the shirt did, I felt like I as a part
of something (some of later jobs never did this, I noticed immediately). 
The coworking space we were in is called the Code Factory, that summer though was great. 
Everyday at lunch we would sit down and eat with three or four other people from various
other companies that shared the space and we'd have intellectual and interesting
conversations. Fridays after work, we'd sometimes have drinks and sometimes we
would have a short Team Fortress 2 LAN party. I got given responsibility, I cared
about the products we were making and tweaked it after feedback with others in
the company. Unfortunately, the company never took off. Great people, I wish them well.

I did my second internship at a services company filled with cubicles, they said
they had culture yet at lunch there was often only two or three people in the lunchroom,
not conversing, in a company with 100+ people. The foosball table gathered dust. 

My third internship was back at the Code Factory, this time at a company supporting an open source project. I was
welcomed with the responsibility I had been given at my first job. We were a small
team of four people (with an extra two in Ecuador). The office was a mess of development
machines and stuff kind of like this:

That wasn't our office, that's an early picture of the JustinTV office but ours wasn't too far
off. Every time we had a small victory we would go
to Chinatown and celebrate with Dim Sum. We went really often to the point that I
eventually got sick of the stuff but it didn't matter, those meals were about more
than just the food and I'd go back for more now. At one point my boss told me about Google using [Lego blocks for
a server case](http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/voy/museum/pictures/display/0-4-Google.htm)
back when they were starting out and we considered doing something similar at one point.
I actually built a Lego case for my Raspberry Pi just because of this, the modularity of
it is awesome, I could build a case to hold a stack of Raspberry Pis to be honest.
In hindsight, I wish I had given that company more of my time, I'd love to be hacking
away at the kind of stuff they're doing still.

After that experience, I ended up at a larger company again but this time one that
was still as casual as a startup but had the perks and benefits of a Silicon Valley
one. It was fun and I learnt more than what I did in three years of college. We had
the pinball machines, the foosball table (that people actually used everyday), the
Cinema displays, the shelves of breakfast cereals, the Coke fridge full of pop, couches,
telepresence robot, you name it. But the two main things that truly added culture
at least in my mind was the daily catered lunches and the two day hackathons we did every
quarter. The good thing about daily catered lunches is it keeps your employees in the
office, more specifically in the same room and because of that people actually converse.
I actually met different people in the company because of this, learnt what they did and
had interesting conversations. The hackathons were also really awesome because they let
people truly express themselves in the form of something they were interested in. I
collaborated with another intern during my first hackathon and we built a traffic light
out of PVC piping that stands taller than me and shows the status of our servers, it's
powered by an Arduino and I think the code is on my Github account too.

Those are the kinds of things that demonstrate a company's culture to me personally,
notice how they they're mostly about people engaging with each other and not a shiny
new computer? Think carefully about your culture and what you say it is,
your employees will quickly determine whether your company actually has it or not.
